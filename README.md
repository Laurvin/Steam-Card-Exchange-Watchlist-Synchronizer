# Steam-Card-Exchange-Watchlist-Synchronizer
Synchs with actual Steam Inventory

This reads in your Steam Inventory and then adds all games you have cards for to the Steam Card Exchange Watchlist and removes all games you do not have cards for.

Please note that you will need to be logged into both Steam and Steam Card Exchange in your browser for this to work.
